Before start learning this module I knew and even used some Linux commands but definitely [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) helped me improve my skills and I hope this tutorial will help me in the future.
As for HTTP part I guess it's not a suitable article for beginners. Too literal translate, too much parentheses, in a word too complicated IMHO. I think there are some another good material in the net.
